#Saluki: Finding Taint-style Vulnerabilities with Static Property Checking
Author: Jacek Janczura

Abstract
============

**Saluki is a framework for checking taint-style (data dependent) security properties in a binary code.
    Saluki is a new tool which is capable of finding a large number of
    CWS[^1] vulnerabilities in real programs. Saluki uses a mixture of
    static and dynamic taint analysis to follow data dependent facts. Saluki
    is proved to be capable of finding vulnerabilities in COTS[^2] including
    0-days.**

INTRODUCTION
============

Recently vendors continue to ship vulnerable programs. Unfortunately to
protect their \"know how\" and intellectual property, source code is not
shipped, which is a big issue. Modern compilers and run-time libraries
have introduced significant complexities to a binary code, which
negatively affect the capabilities of binary analysis tool kits to
analyze binary code. [@binaries] To cope with analysing modern binary
files, a data flow analysis is used for an accurate detection of a wide
range of attacks on a shipped software, including those based on memory
corruption, format-string bugs, command or SQL injection, cross-site
scripting, and so on.([@a7], [@Pietraszek2006])

An example of data flow analysis used for finding such vulnerabilities
is a taint analysis. The main goal of taint analysis is to identify data
flows from attacker-controlled sources to security-sensitive sinks that
do not undergo sanitization.[@a5] [@a6] There are two types of taint
analysis, dynamic and static. [@sdtaint] Dynamic requires run time
support and can achieve low coverage, both of which can result in missed
vulnerabilities. Static analysis, promises to reason about entire
functions or whole programs at once by abstracting program state. As a
result, static analysis tends to miss fewer problems, but can suffer
high false positives if not done with care and is extremely time
consuming. [@saluki]

The solution for that problems is Saluki. This new tool, introduced by a
research group from the Carnegie Mellon University, proposes the third
approach - mixed taint analysis based on random execution. This type of
data flow taint analysis is much faster than the conventional static
approach and finds much more vulnerabilities than dynamic
analysis.[@saluki]

In this report after after introducing some basic concepts, we will
focus on the Saluki's architecture, steps of its execution, some real
life results and tests conducted using vulnerable binaries.

Control Flow Graph - CFG
========================

A CFG is defined to be a directed graph, consisting of vertices that
represent basic blocks of the code and edges that represent control
flow, $G = (V,E,V_e,V_x,T)$ , where: ([@CFG], [@binaries])

-   $V = B âˆª \{v\perp\}$ is a set of nodes corresponding to all basic
    blocks $B$ and a special sink node $v\perp$ that has no instructions
    or outgoing edges;

-   $E \subseteq V \times V$ is a set of control flow edges between
    nodes;

-   $V_e \subseteq V$ is a set of entry nodes;

-   $V_x \subseteq V$ is a set of exit nodes;

-   $T : E \rightarrow \{intraprocedural, interprocedural\}$ assigns a
    label to an edge.

The basic blocks $B$ are defined in a conventional way. Each basic block
$b =< i_0, i_1, . . . , i_n >$ is a consecutive instruction sequence
with $i_0$ being the only entry and in being the only exit. The sink
node $v\perp$ is used to represent unknown control flows, mainly caused
by indirect jumps and indirect calls.[@CFG2] An example of such graph is
depicted in a Fig. [1](#fig:CFG){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:CFG"}.

Taint-style Vulnerabilities
===========================

The term taint-style vulnerabilities has its roots in taint analysis, a
technique for tracing propagation of data through a program.[@a6] Taint
analysis is based on the observation that in order for an attacker to
change the execution of a program illegitimately, attacker must cause a
value that is normally derived from a trusted source to instead be
derived from his own input. We refer to data that originates or is
derived arithmetically from an untrusted input as being tainted.
[@taint2]

Taint analysis can be used for example to check if the data received to
a socket by the function $receive()$ and saved in some buffer does not
leak. It means that it is not sent away by the function $send()$.

In an example shown in a Fig. [2](#fig:taint){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:taint"}, functions and buffers that cannot be dependent
one to another need to be specified. Any data saved by $receive(*buf_a)$
can not be sent away by $send(*buf_b)$.\
Taint analysis is divided into three steps:\

-   **Seeding** - during seeding all the $receive()$ functions need to
    be find in the CFG. Than the memory cells, where the received data
    is saved, need to be tainted. Each tainted memory cell has its index
    number for tracing the leakage path and taint flag. Taint flag
    informs if that specific memory cell has been already tainted or
    not.\

-   **Propagation** - taint propagation resembles spreading of a virus.
    In propagation step all the paths in CFG from $receive(*buf_a)$ to
    $send(*buf_b)$ are traversed and each used memory cell is tainted.\

-   **Checking** - during checking each one of the memory cells in
    $buf_b$ is examined for the taint. Presence of the taint in $buf_b$
    means that received data may be leaked away.\

Dynamic taint-style analysis
----------------------------

In dynamic taint analysis, we first mark input data from un-trusted
sources tainted, then monitor program execution to track how the tainted
attribute propagates and to check when tainted data is used in dangerous
ways. [@taint2] Since dynamic analysis is done in a run time, by running
the binary and following execution taint, for each different input whole
program needs to be rerun from the beginning. In consequence to check
all the possible states thus cover all the possible bugs the
computational complexity of such approach will be extremely high and a
scalability of it will be really poor. That is why in dynamic analysis
only subset of the possible inputs is used to emulate working program.
Therefore taint analysis is an example of an under approximation
Fig.[3](#fig:approximation){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:approximation"} and can not cover all of the possible
vulnerabilities. [@a6][@a7]

-   Pros:

    -   It is fast

    -   No false positive

-   Cons:

    -   Detects only bugs triggered by an executed path at the run time

    -   Always starts at the entry point

Static taint-style analysis
---------------------------

Although static analysis examines all code paths, it has weakness of a
high execution time. Due to it's content independency, static analysis
is possible to examine dead code that actually can not be executed in a
run time. Consequently static taint-style analysis is an example of over
approximation Fig.[3](#fig:approximation){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:approximation"}. Due to the large number of an external
unreachable by the program in the run time states, in the static
analysis we observe a large number of false positives. On the other hand
all the states reachable by the program are the subset of the states
reached by static analysis. It means that among many false positives,
all of the possible bugs will be caught. [@a5][@a6]

-   Pros:

    -   Detects all the bugs

-   Cons:

    -   Many false positives

    -   Takes a long time

Saluki Architecture
===================

Saluki creators came up with a new and novel approach. Instead of under
approximating the states in a run time or statically slowly over
approximating all the possible inputs and impossible states, in case of
Saluki - random parts of code are executed.

In a seeding part all instructions and policies that a user wants to
check are being found in a control flow graph and tainted. Then in a
propagation part, plugin called $\mu$flux executes random parts of the
CFG supplying the random input and goes down the graph.

Thanks to $\mu$flux and executing random parts of CFG, Saluki does not
need to start every time from the beginning as it is in dynamic
analysis. Additionally randomisation of an execution point, lets Saluki
go as far as it is statistically possible in CFG, where in dynamic
analysis going that deep entail extreme rise in the computational
complexity.

On the other hand randomisation of the input makes Saluki achieve a
normally unreachable states like in over approximation. That is why the
states approximation of Saluki is the mixed one.[@a4]\
Saluki's execution can be divided into five steps. Its overall
architecture is shown in a Fig. [4](#fig:saluki){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:saluki"}. [@saluki] :

1.  Load in the specification.

2.  Parse the binary into an intermediate representation (IR[^3])
    suitable for analysis.

3.  Run $\mu$flux[^4] to collect data flow facts about executions from
    every specified source.

4.  Run a solver over the policies, program, and collected facts. The
    solver determines whether the property holds or not.

5.  Saluki outputs example paths where the property does not hold. The
    actual output is not a full path, but instead a condensed form of
    the tainted instructions and a flow ID.

![Saluki Architecture
[@saluki][]{label="fig:saluki"}](Report/images/saluki.png){#fig:saluki width="85%"}

*Specification:* The first step of running Saluki is loading the
vulnerabilities specification. Saluki has already implemented a database
- CWE[^5] with dozens of vulnerabilities. Additionally user can load
customised, user-defined policies using the Saluki's language.\

``` {#saluki-code label="saluki-code" caption="Command injection example"}
    prop recv_to_system ::=
    recv(_,*buf,_,_), system(*cmd) |- never
    s.t. cmd/buf
```

In the Listing 1, there is shown a policy in Saluki language for finding
a command injection.

Command injection vulnerabilities arise when input flows from an input
source to a sink function that executes code.

In this case system should never use data from recv (data received from
the socket). Otherwise we can assume that a command in a system shell
was executed - system used data from the socket.

The only limitation is that Saluki does not specifically reason about
memory corruption vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows.

*Binary processing:* The binary is loaded to the Saluki. Than Saluki
runs a BAP[^6] (BinaryAnalysisPlatform) an open-source plugin-based
binary analysis framework. Deriving a CFG from a binary is a difficult
problem on its own right. The design of these algorithms is a challenge
due to the presence of both indirect control flow that cannot be
statically analyzed and data inter- mixed with code.[@CFG] To that
purpose Saluki uses BAP recursive-traversal parser, that follows
statically determinable control flow to discover as much code as
possible, and makes use of backwards slicing and heuristic techniques to
identify the targets of indirect jumps (e.g., jump tables) and functions
that are only reached via indirect calls. ([@a8], [@BAP])\
*Taint Seeding:* Saluki analyzes the specification for variables used in
constraints. Each constraint variable is linked to a program location,
which is then marked in the IR as a taint seed. In our running example,
cmd is a constraint variable used in recv, causing Saluki to identify
the proper memory location corresponding to the cmd argument in all
terms named recv. As is customary, Saluki uses unique identifiers to
identify each taint seed.[@saluki]

*$\mu$flux:* $\mu$flux is implemented as a custom interpreter that runs
random parts of CFG and propagates the taint across the memory.
$\mu$flux starts taint propagation from the instructions picked from
specification and marked during the seeding. Than it executes parts of
CFG randomly. $\mu$flux explores the paths regardless of the branch
predicate and ignores context of data.

$\mu$flux stops execution when:

-   Pre-defined max. instructions number was excited

-   Saluki calls dynamically linked external function

-   Saluki hits a jump with an indirect target

*The Saluki Solver:* In this step Saluki starts to follow the taint and
tries to prove all properties specified in a policy. Saluki is
constructive: it does not just show that there is a violation, but gives
the specific path and data dependencies used to show the property can be
violated.

Results and tests
=================

Saluki research group tested Saluki on many binaries in order to check
its performance. No only did they find two binaries where srand seed was
time dependent and 6 new zero-days bugs in 5 COTS products, but they
even discovered Heartbleed in OpenSSL. Unfortunately in the same library
Saluki showed 4 false positive alerts. In Lighthttp Saluki research team
found command injection to system, buffer overflow due to wrong usage of
strcpy. Apart from OpenSSL and Lighthttp they found 3 SQL injections in
some COTOS products and many more.

This experiments shows that Saluki may be useful but the user needs to
be aware that a false-positives may occur and that is why it is crucial
to check every alert.

Conclusions
===========

Saluki is not sound nor complete. Its main advantage is that in
comparison to other tools used to find vulnerabilities it is extremely
fast. Unfortunately the authors of Saluki did not benchmark it against
other tools which I think is a big drawback of the paper.

Sadly Saluki is not further developed and after publication the paper
[@saluki] there are no new commits in a Saluki's github repository.
